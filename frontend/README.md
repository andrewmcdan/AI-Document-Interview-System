# Frontend Placeholder

The PDF calls for a web UI that allows users to upload documents and ask questions. This directory is reserved for that client.

Suggested starting point:
- Framework: Next.js or Vite + React for quick file upload flows and streaming answers.
- Features for MVP: upload form, document list, single chat view (question + answer with citations), simple session history.
- Integrations: call the FastAPI backend for `/documents`, `/query`, and `/conversations/{id}/query`.

No dependencies are installed yet; scaffold once the desired frontend stack is chosen.
